We should create push notification topic with all devices listed in it for batch messaging.\n\n4. every access of the app should be preceeded with an http request to www.google.com (and similar websites) to ensure the device has internet connectivity.\n\n5. in our api we should also be able to send app configuration - mainly - to activate background service fetching data from the API every 5-20 minutes - in case out push notification appid project is blocked by google.\n\n6. we need to integrate with Shon's api:\n- link generation api (to send users for first install\n- get user details (bank, id etc...)\n\n7. first installation should also be monitored and performed in batches - every batch should be generated with different destination IP addresses.\n\n\n"
